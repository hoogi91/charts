### Release Management

This extension uses [**semantic versioning**][1], which means, that
* **bugfix updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bugfixes or security relevant stuff without breaking changes,
* **minor updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller tasks without breaking changes,
* and **major updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) breaking changes wich can be refactorings, features or bugfixes.
